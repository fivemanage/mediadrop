## Discord Authentication (Optional)

If you want to restrict uploads to users with a specific role in your Discord server, you can enable Discord authentication. No database is requiredâ€”sessions are managed with secure cookies.

### How it works
- If the Discord environment variables are set, users will be required to sign in with Discord and have the specified role to access the app.
- The middleware automatically redirects unauthenticated users to the login page.
- If Discord auth is not configured, the app is open to everyone.

### Required Environment Variables
Add these to your `.env` file:

```
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=your_discord_client_id
DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET=your_discord_client_secret
DISCORD_REDIRECT_URI=https://yourdomain.com/api/auth/discord-callback
DISCORD_GUILD_ID=your_discord_guild_id
DISCORD_ROLE_ID=the_required_role_id
SESSION_PASSWORD=complex_password_at_least_32_characters
SESSION_COOKIE_NAME=mediadrop_discord_session
```

- `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID` and `DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET`: From your Discord Developer Portal.
- `DISCORD_REDIRECT_URI`: Should match your deployed domain and Discord app settings.
- `DISCORD_GUILD_ID`: Your Discord server's ID.
- `DISCORD_ROLE_ID`: The role ID required for access.
- `SESSION_PASSWORD`: A strong, random string (32+ chars) for session encryption.
- `SESSION_COOKIE_NAME`: (Optional) Name for the session cookie.

### What happens when enabled?
- Users are redirected to `/login` and must sign in with Discord.
- Only users with the required role in your server can access uploads.
- All session data is stored in a secure, encrypted cookie (no database needed).
